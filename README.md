# Autograd C++

Gilbert Fran√ßois Duivesteijn



## Abstract

The doublet object is designed for evaluating algoritmic derivatives (AD) in forward mode or Tangent Linear Mode (TLM). In the literature, this method is also called automatic or computational differentiation.  The tangent value for the dependent value will be automatically evaluated by replacing the "double" type with the "doublet" object.
